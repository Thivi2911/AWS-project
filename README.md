# AWS-project
This repository contains the cloudformation file to deploy the infrastructure of AWS with wordpress installed. 
Later I created an image out of the instance created via cloudformation.
Then created a launch template, autoscaling group.
In auto scaling group, scheduled the time for the instances, which can only be available at scheduled time
